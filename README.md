# GaiaSenses
Mobile application for generating audiovisual compositions from planetary platforms 

## Our Mission

Finding creative ways to put climate change in the spotlight is essential to motivating the participation that drives action. This proposal presents a collaborative project for the development of a mobile application, GaiaSenses, accessing planetary bases for the generation of audiovisual works. Such compositions will be created from the local region data and will serve as an alert for local weather conditions. The compositions can be shared through social networks, eventually triggering actions to protect biodiversity. The GaiaSenses project has strong potential to aggregate efforts, generate synergies and contributions in the scientific, technological, artistic and social contexts.
